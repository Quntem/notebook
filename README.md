# Notebook

Quntem's latest project: an amazing, open-source alternative to Google Docs and Microsoft Word. Heads up: this project was made for [Hack Club's Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/) and may be quite unstable! Feel free to contribute to the repository and reporting critical issues that need to be seen immediately!

## What is Notebook?

Notebook is a cool and community-driven alternative to Google Docs and Microsoft Word and was made for [de-googlization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle). It has many features that Docs and Word doesn't have in the works- and we hope to see you enjoy them! Please star the repository to keep Notebook **free**, forever.

## How do you use Notebook?

We currently don't have a way for users to quickly access Notebook with a website. This is because Notebook is currently in heavy development- most features have not been done and are waiting to receive further testing. The only way you could test Notebook is to request for the .env file and host it locally. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.

## Why Notebook?

We offer more features than similar apps such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word such as:

- Notebook Script
- Signing in with **Google** _(Not recommended)_, **Discord** and **Github**.
- APIs
